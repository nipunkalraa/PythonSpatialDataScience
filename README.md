# Leveraging Python for Spatial Data Science

[CARTO Spatial Data Science Bootcamps](https://spatial-data-science-conference.com/bootcamps/2023/) | March 23, 2023

Instructor: [Will Geary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willgeary/), Senior Data Scientist at [Revel Transit](https://gorevel.com/)

## Optional Setup

This workshop will require Python 3 and several packages, including `geopandas`, `contextily`, `seaborn`, `libpysal`, `esda`, `splot`, and `osmnx`. 

You can simply install the above in your own existing Python enviroment, or if you wish, you may optionally spin up a conda environment called `spatialstats` to exactly match mine with:

`conda env create --file environment.yml --force`

and activate it with:

`conda activate spatialstats`
